# Data Engineering Technical Challenge

## Overview

The main goal of this project is to process customer, loan, and payment data using a simple ETL pipeline and build a small analytical environment for reporting and visualization.

The project includes:

- CSV ingestion using Python
- Basic data cleaning and validation
- PostgreSQL staging layer
- Dimensional data warehouse model
- Analytical SQL views
- Business queries
- Power BI dashboard
- Dockerized local environment

# Data Sources

The project works with three datasets:

- Customers
- Loans
- Payments

CSV files are stored inside the `data/raw` folder.

---

# ETL Process

## Extract

The CSV files are loaded using Pandas.

## Transform

Some basic validations and transformations were applied:

- Column normalization
- Invalid date validation
- Null handling
- Duplicate validation
- Basic cleaning

## Load

The cleaned data is loaded into PostgreSQL staging tables.

---

# Staging Layer

The staging schema contains:

- staging.clientes
- staging.creditos
- staging.pagos
- staging.error_records

This layer helps separate raw ingestion from the analytical model.

---

# Data Warehouse

A simple star schema model was created to support reporting in Power BI.

## Dimensions

- dim_cliente
- dim_producto

## Facts

- fact_creditos
- fact_pagos

---

# Data Quality Checks

Some validation queries were added to identify:

- Invalid dates
- Duplicate customers
- Payments without loans
- Loans without customers
- Invalid amounts

A few invalid records were intentionally kept from the source files to validate the checks.

---

# Analytical Views

The following SQL views were created:

- vw_cartera_total
- vw_pagos_metodo
- vw_creditos_ciudad
- vw_clientes_segmento
- vw_clientes_activos
- vw_creditos_aprobados
- vw_promedio_pagos

---

# Business Queries

Some exploratory business queries were added, including:

- Top customers by approved amount
- Portfolio distribution by city
- Payment analysis by method
- Approved loan analysis

---

# Power BI Dashboard

A Power BI dashboard was created with:

- KPI cards
- Loan analysis by city
- Payment method distribution
- Loan status analysis
- Top customers
- Interactive filters

---

# Challenges Found

During development some issues were identified in the source data and modeling process:

- Invalid payment dates
- Duplicate records
- Missing relationships between some payments and loans
- Ambiguous relationships between fact tables in Power BI

These cases were reviewed using validation queries and adjustments in the data model.

# How to Run

## 1. Create virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

## 2. Activate environment (Windows)

```bash
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

## 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 4. Start PostgreSQL container

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## 5. Execute ETL pipeline

```bash
python -m src.main
```
